How send from the browser client a Javascript Timestamp value to the ROS Node?

Observations:
   - I was defining for the ROS node a custom message with the types 'time' or 'duration':
        -  I was trying to use this custom message to send a Javascript Timestamp to the ROS Node, but it was receiving a zero value:
              - The fields 'secs' and 'nsecs' have zero value
